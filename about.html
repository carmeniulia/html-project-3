    "Fantastic day out. Did my first skydive and it was awesome. The place has a canteen 
    and toilet facilities, also a campsite on the airfield if you want to go and camp there. 
    The staff at the place are great. You get a briefing and some training, wait your turn 
    and then up in the plane. I did a tandem skydive and would definitely do another."

    "WOW! I was absolutely terrified but what an experience. Nicky who was my tandem buddy was 
    fantastic and kept me at ease as did Brian the photographer. They both made the experience 
    better for me by trying to make me feel relaxed (not possible). The weather was perfect so 
    the scenery was spectacular. You must get it photographed as you can watch it time and again. 
    The DVD and all the photos are worth every penny. Highly recommended."

    Fantastic organisation. My wife did a tandem skydive today - top of her list of 48 things to do 
    before she's 49! The team  made this a truly exceptional experience for her. 
    From the moment she registered we knew she was in good hands. The briefing was thorough but made
    her feel at ease. Her instructor was reassuring, funny and made her feel totally
    comfortable with what she was about to do. She immediately felt she was in safe hands. After his 
    8,000+ jumps she certainly was! Her 'personal' cameraman, Stevie, also added to her feeling confident       even though she was too apprehensive to say too much to camera initially! Brian continued to make her 
    at ease during the flight to 14,000 feet and even during the jump itself kept talking her through what 
     could be seen etc. If we could give them 6 stars. <br><br><br>
